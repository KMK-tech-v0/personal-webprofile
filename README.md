# Personal Web Profile

This repository contains the source for my personal web profile hosted in the `notion-project` directory. It includes:

- Static HTML pages
- An `assets/` folder with images and video
- Supporting text files

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the profile locally.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page
- `notion.html`, `notion-compact.html` – alternate pages
- `assets/` – images, video, and other media

## Development

No build step is required. You can edit the HTML and assets directly.

## Deploy

You can deploy using GitHub Pages by setting the Pages source to the `main` branch and the root directory.
